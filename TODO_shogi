tagua core:
- tagua should make promotion an option to the user
  -> maybe by splitting target square if canPromote(), so the piece
     gets promoted if it gets dropped in second half of the square ?
- gnushogi engine gets confused when moving through history => generic pb ?
- tooltips for figurines, for people who can't read kanji

shogi variant:
- pools overlap when too many pieces were captured
- decorated move could show captured piece

gnushogi engine:
- gnushogi engine should catch "Illegal move: " notices from gnushogi
- engine should detect endgame conditions from gnushogi:
	"Drawn game!" "Black mates!"
  (gnushogi only reports a draw on one side !?)
- support x?(save|get) commands (need tagua support ?)

other shogi:
- implement ACS protocol and shogi-server extended commands
	http://www.computer-shogi.org/protocol/tcp_ip_server_11_e.html
	http://shogi-server.sourceforge.jp/protocol.html
- support for GPS Shogi engine
