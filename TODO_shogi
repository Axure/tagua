- finalize deserialization breakages
- PGN save should write variant tag
- PGN load confused after returning from variations - gamestate issue ?
- save/load support for PalView continuations: (* 10. f5)

tagua core:
- gnushogi engine gets confused when moving through history => generic pb ?
- tooltips for figurines, for people who can't read kanji
- allow for more complex moves (eg. Lion in Chu Shogi)
  -> maybe by splitting target square, so the piece gets all different
     moves in one click, depending on which part of the square is hit ?
- allow to setup and play problems (tsume shogi)

engines/core:
- engine options (eg. select difficulty level)
- do not allow selection of more than 1 engine for the same side
- allow to declare engines system-wide

shogi variant:
- pools overlap when too many pieces were captured
- decorated move could show captured piece

gnushogi engine:
- gnushogi engine should catch "Illegal move: " notices from gnushogi
- engine should detect endgame conditions from gnushogi:
	"Drawn game!" "Black mates!"
  (gnushogi only reports a draw on one side !?)
- support for time

other shogi:
- implement ACS protocol and shogi-server extended commands
