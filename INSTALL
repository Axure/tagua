What you need
==================

  * A KDE4 development environment with kdelibs and libkdegames (>= KDE 3.92)
  * boost 1.34 (headers will suffice)

Further you will need GNU make, a working C++ compiler (e.g. gcc 3.4.x or later)
and CMake 2.4.7 or later.

The following packages are optional:

  * lua (5.1.1, if it is not available you can use the internal copy)

Preparations
==================

Setting up a KDE4 development environment:

Follow the tutorial at http://techbase.kde.org/Getting_Started/Build/KDE4

Alternatively, you can install KDE beta packages if your system supports them 
(e.g. debian, kubuntu, openSUSE).

Compiling Tagua
==================

Unpack the Tagua package, change to the package root directory, and type:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$KDEDIR -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release ..
make -j2
make install

If you want tagua to be linked to system lua instead that the internall one,
add -DSYSTEM_LUA=1 to the command line, and optionally add -DLUA_PKG=xyz to
specify the pkg-config lua package.
