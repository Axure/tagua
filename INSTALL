What you need
==================

  * qt (at least a 4.2 snapshot)
  * kdelibs
  * boost headers

Further you will need GNU make, a working C++ compiler (e.g. gcc 3.4.x or later)
and CMake 2.4.3 or later.

The following packages are optional:

  * X11 headers (UNIX only - to enable task bar flashing)
  * lua (5.1.1, if it is not available you can use the internal copy)

Preparations
==================

Installing CMake:

Get the latest version of CMake from http://www.cmake.org/
unpack, run "./configure && make && make install" will install into /usr/local.

Ensure cmake is in your $PATH.

Compiling KBoard
==================

Unpack the KBoard package, change to the package root directory, and type:

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
make
make install

If you want kboard to be linked to system lua instead that the internall one,
and -DSYSTEM_LUA=1 to the command line, and optionally add -DLUA_PKG=xyz to
specify the pkg-config lua package.
