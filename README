Tagua - A generic board game application

types of games, and has a powerful plugin system which makes it
easy to add more. Just let your imagination decide. =)

===========================================
Why the name

Tagua is the name of a plant where vegetal ivory is extracted.
Ivory because of it's wide usage while making board games, vegetal
because we love animals and elephants. <3
