Introduction
===============
Tagua is a generic board game application and framewok for KDE.
It can be used as a replacement for chess applications like XBoard and 
Winboard, both for playing in internet servers and for local editing of games.
However, Tagua is much more: it has an extensible board game infrastructure
which makes developing new board games extremely easy. So far, a number of
games have been developed, including Chess, Shogi and Xiangqi.

Feature list
===============
* Local editing of games:
  Games of chess and a number of variants (see below) can be edited and played locally.
  A user friendly and graphically appealing move list control provides a mean to visualize complicated subvariant nesting.
* FICS / ICC compatible server support:
  Tagua can manage a connection to a FICS-like server, with which the user can interact using a detachable console.
  Games of any chess variant can be played, examined and observed.
* Generic game support:
  Many board games can be easily implemented using the extensible Tagua infrastructure. So far, the following board games are implemented:
    - Chess
    - Chess 5x5
    - Crazyhouse
    - Shogi
    - Minishogi
* Graphics:
  Tagua features an advanced animation engine which can be easily extended on a per-variant basis.
  It includes a powerful theme loader based on lua scripts that allows to dynamically create effects like drop down shadows. Themes can customize the appearance of pieces, board squares and borders, clocks, backgrounds and the layout of all these elements.
